# Dice-Jack
Dice-Jack is a two player web-game based on black-jack, which utilizes JavaScript, HTML and CSS to provide an aesthetically pleasing and dynamic environment for the user. In this game, two players compete to get their score closest to, but not above 11. Players roll a die to determine their points and can then choose to roll again for another chance to add to their score or hold.
